 Our project is a simple card simulator.  You can simulate the play of simple card games using variations
 of the shuffle, draw, and deal functions.
 
 Upon opening the game the deck will automatically be initialized and shuffled.
 
 To draw cards, enter a valid number between 1 and 52 and click the "Draw" button. The drawn card or set 
 of cards will appear in the output.
 
 To deal cards a a number of players, enter a valid number of cards between 1 and 52 and a valid number of players
 (the number of players multiplied by the number of cards must be a number between 1 and 52) and click the "Deal" 
 button. The dealt cards, separated by player, will appear in the output.
 
 To re-shuffle the current remaining deck at any point, press the "Shuffle Deck" button.
 
 To view the current remaining deck, click the "Display Deck" button. The deck will print to output in its current
 order.
 
 To reset the deck to ascending order, starting with spades, then hearts, then diamonds, then clubs, press the "Reset
 Deck" button.
